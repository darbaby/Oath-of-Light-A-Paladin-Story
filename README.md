Sir Caelan, a lone paladin sworn to the Oath of Devotion, arrives at the base of Xonthal’s Tower, where rumors tell of the Cult of the Dragon using its warped magical halls for dark experiments. The surrounding hedge maze pulses with chaotic magic, but Caelan’s divine resolve guides him forward.

Inside, Caelan faces traps, planar puzzles, and corrupted elementals twisted by dragon sorcery. His unwavering faith, combined with righteous fury and a radiant blade, allows him to strike down the cult leader—a necrotic sorcerer channeling power from Tiamat herself.

In the end, Caelan shatters the soul crystal fueling the tower’s illusions, freeing the trapped spirits and sealing the evil within forever.
